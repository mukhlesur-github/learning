git branch -- to check which all branch we have 
* points the current branch

we can create branch using 

git branch z_mmr_branch

whatever the base branch you are in most probably the main branch, 
everythin will get copied into this z_mmr_branch

git branch -b new_branch_name base_branch_name 

this is to create a new_branch from a base_branch_name

-b for base

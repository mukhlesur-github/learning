git is local
gitlab/github/bit bucket is remote site or origin

what ever we are developing in local we can push that into origin

we also can pull code from origin made changes and push the same into origin again.


git pull - to pull the code from origin 

make changes in the code 

now to check which codes got changes you can check using

git status

once you get all the untracked files, meaning files where changes have made then add the same in the stage to do that

git add file.py  - it will only stage the file.py

git add .  - at once to stage all the changed files

to commit all the staged files at once 

git commit -m "meaningfull commit messages"

code is commited and now you can push the same into the origin or gitlab in main branch

git push origin main

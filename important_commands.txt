git is local
gitlab/github/bit bucket is remote site or origin

what ever we are developing in local we can push that into origin

we also can pull code from origin made changes and push the same into origin again.

scenerio 1:
git pull - to pull the code from origin 

make changes in the code 

now to check which codes got changes you can check using

git status

once you get all the untracked files, meaning files where changes have made then add the same in the stage to do that

git add file.py  - it will only stage the file.py

git add .  - at once to stage all the changed files

to commit all the staged files at once 

git commit -m "meaningfull commit messages"

code is commited and now you can push the same into the origin or gitlab in main branch

git push origin main   


scenerio 2:

create local directory, write code

initialize git in the pwd

git init

check whether initialized or not
there must be ./ file

git status 

set the origin value with the url where you want to push the developed code in local,
you can get the url from github https link of the repository


git remote add origin https://github.com/mukhlesur-github/learning.git

now again same process

git add file.py

git commit -m "message"

git branch to check the branch name if its master change the name 

git branch -M main -- this will change the current branch name into main

git push origin main  -- to finally push the files into github

you can set upsteam value as well to not right git push oring main everytime

git push -u oring main -- this will set the default upstream as origin main so from next time only

git push -- will work
